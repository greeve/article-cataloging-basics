Authority control 

Libraries are in the business of acquiring, processing, maintaining, and circulating to patrons information resources (i.e. monographs, journals, reference materials, articles, archival manuscripts, videos, databases, maps, etc.).

To help in the acquisition, processing, maintenance, and circulation of information resources libraries create inventories and catalogs.

Cataloging results in the creation of cataloging records that contain attributes to distinguish

Cataloging refers to the set of activities and processes to describe information resources (e.g. books, monographs, journals, reference materials, articles, e-books, archival manuscripts, videos, music, or maps). 

The description of an information resource requires choosing main headings or terms to identify the resource. 

Cataloging produces bibliographic records that contain this description including these headings. The bibliographic record acts as a surrogate for the information resource. 

Authority control (or authority work) is the set of activities and processes to establish, through verification and validation, controlled forms of entities (i.e. people, places, corporate bodies, families, subjects, and genres) used as the main headings in the catalog record.

Cataloging refers to the set of activities and processes to create bibliographic metadata that describes information resources (e.g. books, monographs, journals, reference materials, articles, e-books, archival manuscripts, videos, music, or maps).

Metadata describing an information resource contains headings or terms to facilitate finding the resource, uniquely identify the resource, and collocate the resource with other related resources.

Authority control (or authority work) is the set of activities and processes to establish, through verification and validation, controlled forms of entities (i.e. people, places, corporate bodies, families, works, expressions, series, subjects, and genres) used as main headings in bibliographic metadata. 

Authority control results in the creation of a database of consistent, unique terms representing the entities used to describe information resources. Authority metadata (or the statements that describe an authority entity) are grouped together to form an authority record. The authority record consists of the unique, authorized heading, variant terms, related terms, other associated attributes, and sources of information to validate the metadata recorded for the term.
