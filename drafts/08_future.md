# Draft

Various initiatives and pilot projects look to shape the future of authority control and identity management. Developed by the Library of Congress, BIBFRAME represents the future of bibliographic description that is increasingly plugged into the world of the semantic web and linked data. BIBFRAME is a new encoding standard for bibliographic metadata and description that is aimed at replacing the current MARC 21 format. It promises improved interoperability for cooperative cataloging and sharing as well as connecting to broader non-library communities on the WWW. BIBFRAME represents a move away from thinking of bibliographic metadata as carefully crafted metadata records towards a focus on each element or attribute in a metadata record as metadata that can be combined and mixed in varying ways and levels not typical with current bibliographic description. The atomization of bibliographic description places a greater need towards consistent, predictable library metadata that authority control is designed to provide. The Linked Data for Libraries (LD4L) set of initiatives and grants represent the efforts of major academic institutions along with the Library of Congress and the PCC collaborating on how to implement the future of catalog metadata and description with BIBFRAME at its center in a shared, cooperative library community. Practical efforts center around catalog metadata creation, indexing, searching, and display as well as how larger WWW communities like Wikidata connect to these efforts. How authority control will inform and shape this future is an area of future research and exploration.

Recent pilot projects have the potential to shape the future of authority control and authority metadata. The PCC URIs in MARC records pilot initiated by the Library of Congress and the PCC explores applying principles of linked data and the semantic web to more consistent and pervasive identifier creation and identity maintenance. The use of standard identifiers enable connecting traditionally siloed library metadata to the larger WWW and semantic web communities. The PCC Wikidata pilot is exploring the future of identity management by looking at Wikidata both as a source for authority metadata that could enrich existing library metadata as well as be a location for publishing existing authority and bibliographic metadata that would benefit library and non-library communities alike. The Shared entity management infrastructure project is a project being developed by OCLC to create a persistent, shared, and centralized system for managing identifiers and metadata for library information resources. This project aims to create an authoritative database of library metadata to connect library collections and resources to communities and resources on the larger WWW and semantic web.
