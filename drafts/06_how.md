# Draft

In the process of cataloging an information resource the cataloger chooses main headings to provide a predictable heading, to uniquely identify the resource (e.g. by choosing the item’s author, series title, subject, additional contributors, etc.) and to collate related resources. The terms chosen for these main headings come from an authority database. If the chosen heading to best represent the information resource exists in their library’s local authority database they will use that existing heading. If the entity doesn’t exist yet in their local authority database the cataloger will establish that authority entity by creating a new authority record in a cooperative authority database (if they participate in a cooperative cataloging program) and by also adding the new record to their local authority database.

Libraries maintain a local authority file using a variety of means including batch loading records, partnering with library vendors, participating in cooperative cataloging programs, and manually creating or editing authority records one-by-one. A library’s local authority database is typically maintained as part of their integrated library system (ILS) alongside other library metadata including bibliographic records. To disambiguate similar resources and collate related resources the ILS forms relationships between authority records and bibliographic records by indexing all the records used by a particular term. 

For example, an authority record representing the corporate body Apple, Inc. has a reference to the authority record representing the corporate body’s founder, Steve Jobs. Bibliographic records for information resources attributed to Apple, Inc. or about Apple, Inc. will include this name as a heading in the bibliographic record. The ILS does the work to index and collate these related records for later search and retrieval. The library catalog or discovery system that a library uses to help patrons search, browse, and discover information resources offered can utilize the information recorded in the authority record to collate materials with bibliographic metadata that shares the same authorized headings, direct patrons from variant forms and terms to the authorized form, and disambiguate similar headings in search results.

A library’s local authority database stands in contrast to cooperative (or aggregate) authority databases maintained at a regional, national, or international scale. Libraries can participate in cooperative cataloging programs allowing them access to a pool of shared authority records as well as the ability to contribute new or updated records to the shared database. The Library of Congress’s Program for Cooperative Cataloging (PCC) maintains various cooperative cataloging initiatives including the Name Authority Cooperative Program (NACO) and the Subject Authority Cooperative Program (SACO). These two cooperative programs work with OCLC, Inc. to create and maintain a national database of authority records that can be leveraged by libraries in the creation and maintenance of their own local catalog. Libraries participating in these cooperative programs can leverage automated ways of brining records from the shared cooperative databases into their local authority database.
