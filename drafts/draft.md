# History

Library catalogs are databases of metadata that describe the information resources available in a library or network of libraries. 

The metadata describing these information resources are organized into catalog records also referred to as a bibliographic records.

The kinds of metadata in a catalog record can be broken down into the following categories:

- access points
- bibliographic description
- location

The library catalog has taken various forms over the years from lists of entries in printed books, to file drawers of index cards where each card represents one information resource, to networked computer databases storing digital metadata representing each unique information resource.

The history of authority control is intertwined with the history of library cataloging and is concerned with the development of theory, principles, and practices for creating, maintaining, and sharing a library catalog. 

Working for the British Library in the early to mid 19th century, Anthony Panizzi established a 91-rule plan to "systematize the operation of cataloging" (Lubetzky, 1956).

These rules created a prototype of modern day catalog records with entry headings, descriptions, references, and notes.

Panizziâ€™s 91 rules demonstrated the value of creating uniform headings for recording information about library materials in the library catalog. 

This creates consistent metadata used to find library materials and collocate related library materials.

In the late 19th century [Charles Ammi Cutter's objects and means for the catalog][2] codified the purpose to connect patrons to library materials while shaping the kind of information recorded to achieve this end. 

LC and card catalog

The [Statement of Principles adopted by the International Conference on Cataloguing Principles (ICCP) organized in Paris, France (also known as the "Paris Principles")][3] and [Seymour Lubetzky][4] showed the value of simplifying and standardizing cataloging rules to create a universal standard allowing interoperability between library catalogs.

MARC and computerization of the catalog
    - what does this have to do with authority control (not just cataloging in general?)
    - automation
        - first printed catalogs
        - second digital, online catalogs
    - networking
        - improve sharing records between libraries

# Definition
