## Abstract section

This paper provides an understanding of the history of authority control in the context of the development of general cataloging practice, beginning with basic tenets for the creation and maintenance of a library catalog outlined by Cutter (1876) and the Paris Principles. Emphasis is given to the impact of library computerization, enabling more efficient cataloging and improved patron access.

# Draft

The history of authority control is intertwined with the history of cataloging and the library catalog.

Cataloging principles and practices were shaped by [Panizzi's 91 cataloging rules][1], [Cutter's objects and means for the catalog][2], the [Statement of Principles adopted by the International Conference on Cataloguing Principles (ICCP) organized in Paris, France (also known as the "Paris Principles")][3], and the principles and influence of [Seymour Lubetzky][4] on cataloging code design.

Begining as a printed inventory list the library catalog has evolved into a sophistocated database to aid in the maintenance and discovery of library materials.

The library catalog has two core functions or objectives: 

1. The finding function
2. The collocating function

The finding function enables patrons of the catalog to uniquely identify an item by author, title, series, subject, or genre. 

The collocating function enables patrons to see all the items in the library by (or about) an author, title, series, subject, or genre.

This also enables seeing related items and all editions of an item.

Authority control creates a syndetic structure within the catalog relating records by people, corporate bodies, titles, series, subjects and genres. 

A key event in the history of authority control includes a [series of institutes in 1979 held by the Library and Information Technology Association (LITA) exploring the future of authority control in the library catalog][5].

Automation of the catalog (first by storing/maintaining the authority metadata in a database to automate the creation of physical catalog cards, next to the total conversion of the catalog records and cards to an computer environment, and later to the use and development of computer networking technologies) enables cooperative cataloging and federated databases of authority records.
