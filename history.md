## Abstract section

This paper provides an understanding of the history of authority control in the context of the development of general cataloging practice, beginning with basic tenets for the creation and maintenance of a library catalog outlined by Cutter (1876) and the Paris Principles. Emphasis is given to the impact of library computerization, enabling more efficient cataloging and improved patron access.

# Draft

The history of authority control is intertwined with the history of cataloging and the library catalog.

Cataloging principles and practices were shaped by [Panizzi's 91 cataloging rules][1], [Cutter's objects and means for the catalog][2], the [Statement of Principles adopted by the International Conference on Cataloguing Principles (ICCP) organized in Paris, France (also known as the "Paris Principles")][3], and the principles and influence of [Seymour Lubetzky][4] on cataloging code design.

Begining as a printed inventory list the library catalog has evolved into a sophistocated database to aid in the maintenance and discovery of library materials.

The library catalog has two core functions or objectives: 

1. The finding function
2. The collocating function

The finding function enables patrons of the catalog to uniquely identify an item by author, title, series, subject, or genre. 

The collocating function enables patrons to see all the items in the library by (or about) an author, title, series, subject, or genre.

This also enables seeing related items and all editions of an item.

Authority control creates a syndetic structure within the catalog relating records by people, corporate bodies, titles, series, subjects and genres. 

A key event in the history of authority control includes a [series of institutes in 1979 held by the Library and Information Technology Association (LITA) exploring the future of authority control in the library catalog][5].

Automation of the catalog (first by storing/maintaining the authority metadata in a database to automate the creation of physical catalog cards, next to the total conversion of the catalog records and cards to an computer environment, and later to the use and development of computer networking technologies) enables cooperative cataloging and federated databases of authority records.

The history of authority control is intertwined with the history of library cataloging. 

The history of library cataloging is concerned with the development of theory, principles, and practices for creating, maintaining, and sharing a library catalog. 

The library catalog is the register of all bibliographic items (i.e. information objects) available in a library. 

This register records various kinds of information about each information object in the library’s collection and has taken on varying forms and styles over the years as cataloging principles and practices were discovered and developed. 

Panizzi established a 91-rule plan to "systematize the operation of cataloging" (Lubetzky, 1956).

These rules created a prototype of modern day catalog records with entry headings, descriptions, references, and notes.

Panizzi’s 91 rules demonstrated the value of creating uniform headings for recording information about library materials in the library catalog. 

This creates consistent metadata used to find library materials and collocate related library materials.

[Cutter's objects and means for the catalog][2] codified the purpose to connect patrons to library materials while shaping the kind of information recorded to achieve this end. 

The [Statement of Principles adopted by the International Conference on Cataloguing Principles (ICCP) organized in Paris, France (also known as the "Paris Principles")][3] and [Seymour Lubetzky][4] showed the value of simplifying and standardizing cataloging rules to create a universal standard allowing interoperability between library catalogs.

Up until the late 20th century library catalogs were analog in form ranging from a list of library materials organized alphabetically by the author’s last name and published in a book to a file of index cards. Each card in the file contained a main entry heading at the top followed by other descriptive detail and physical location in the library to help patrons find the item they needed. In these forms items in the library catalog authored by the same person would be collocated together in the list or index card file. Entries (either in a list or on a card) would also contain references to other headings and items helping guide the patron to their desired item.

The development of computer technology first enabled computerizing the production of the analog catalog making the production and maintenance of the catalog more efficient. As computer technology improved and computer networking technology was developed the library catalog was converted to a computer environment removing the need to publish an analog catalog list or card file. 

In a computer environment creating and updating catalog metadata became much more efficient. 

This also enabled the ability for libraries to share catalog metadata between computers and computer networks.

Libraries adopted integrated library systems developed by various software companies that connected various library functions to the catalog metadata (e.g. acquisitions, circulation, and discovery). 

The move of library catalogs to computer environments, the increased adoption of personal computing devices, and the development of online search engines improved patron access by expanding spatial and temporal boundaries to the catalog.
