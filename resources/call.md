## Cataloging and Classification: Back to Basics

The cataloging and classification field is changing rapidly. New concepts and models, such as linked data, identity management, the IFLA Library Reference Model, and discovery products, are starting to change how libraries provide access to their collections. Yet, to understand these concepts more fully, students and practitioners need to understand the basic theory and history underlying them. For example, what is descriptive cataloging and why is it important? What is the purpose of authority control and how does it help users? How does cataloging work provide value for libraries? This special issue of Cataloging & Classification Quarterly will get back to basics by providing readers with targeted introductions to important library cataloging and classification concepts, standards, and issues. Each article will provide a brief history of the topic, a description of the topic and how it is used, its importance in libraries, and discuss current trends and issues. The target audience for these articles will be students, new practitioners, and anyone looking to refresh their knowledge.
