# Proposal Abstract Draft

## Brief history

Authority control is rooted in the foundations of cataloging. Principles outlined by Cutter (1876) and the Paris principles for the creation and maintenance of a library catalog are part of this foundation. Schmierer (1980), Runkle (1980), and Malinconoco (1979) build on this foundation and establish essential reading on the place of authority in information science and information management. 

## Description

Libraries are in the business of acquiring, storing, maintaining, preserving, and providing access to items and collections of items (i.e. information objects). Catalogers describe these items and collections to provide intellectual, physical, and digital access to items and collections. Metadata is the description catalogers create to describe and inventory these items and collections. Well recorded metadata enables access to information objects in time of need. Cataloging includes a range of activities and processes for creating metadata to describe information resources. These activities include description, subject analysis, classification, and authority control. Authority control is the process of establishing, through verification and validation, controlled forms of entities (i.e. people, places, corporate bodies, families, subjects, and genres) that are used to describe information resources. Authority records are explained in relation to authority control, cataloging, and catalog records.

## How used

Authority control establishes a database of consistent, unique headings that includes variant terms, related terms, other associated information to help disambiguate entities, and notes about the authority including sources of information. The terms in this database act as a controlled vocabulary that is used when cataloging information resources. Individual libraries create and maintain this authority database in connection with their integrated library system. National and cooperative programs establish a collective authority database that libraries can pull from as well as contribute to (i.e. PCC, NACO, SACO, etc.). Libraries use a variety of means to maintain their authority database (i.e. authority file) including via batch loading, partnering with library vendors, participating in cooperative cataloging programs, and manual record-by-record maintenance. 

## Importance

Authority control establishes consistent, reliable, and unique headings to help library patrons and staff meet their information retrieval needs to find specific items and show what the library has by a particular attribute of information resources. Examples of how authority control benefits patrons and staff are shown. 

## Current trends and issues

Current practices and technologies are discussed in relation to authority control including computer and networking technologies. The move towards the semantic web and linked data technologies continues to shape the practices of authority control in libraries. Encoding formats and the move towards connecting authorities to other real world entities on resources like VIAF, Wikipedia, and ISNI is discussed. While the practices and technologies used to implement authority control continue to evolve, the underlying foundational principles and purposes remain the same.
