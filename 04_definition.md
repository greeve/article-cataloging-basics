# Definition


"Knowledge carefully recorded is knowledge available in time of need"[ref]. 

- predictable (e.g. if I want to find works by or about Mark Twain I search under Twain, Mark not Clemens, Samuel)
- differentiate or disambiguate or reconcile between entities and seeming duplicate entities (e.g. Thomas Mann vs. Thomas Mann; James Dean vs. James Dean; Harrison Ford vs. Harrison Ford)
- collate related and like resources (find all resources by William Shakespeare vs. about William Shakespeare)

# Draft 1

Authority control (or authority work) is the set of activities and processes to establish, through verification and validation, controlled forms of entities (i.e. people, places, corporate bodies, families, series, works, expressions, subjects, and genres) used in information resource description (i.e. cataloging). 

Cataloging is the set of activities and processes to describe information resources, including description, subject analysis and classification. 

Describing information resources involves choosing headings or terms to help identify the resource. Cataloging produces bibliographic records that contain metadata describing information resources. The bibliographic record acts as a surrogate for the information resource. Authority control creates a database of consistent, unique terms that includes variant terms, related terms, other associated attributes, and sources of information to disambiguate entities. These various elements that distinguish one entity from another are recorded together in an authority record. This database of authority records can also be referred to as an authority file. The established or “authorized” form chosen in an authority record is the form used in creating bibliographic records that describe information resources acquired by a library. 

Authority records consist of four major components: the authorized form of the entity, variant forms (i.e. synonyms), attributes and information about the entity, and source information to support the choices made in establishing this entity. Authority records can be formatted using various metadata encoding standards. Libraries primarily encode authority records using the MARC format for authority data (refs/footnote?). Figure 1 illustrates an authority record for a person entity. (highlight the different parts of the authority record). Additional examples illustrate authority records for a place, corporate body, family, series, work, expression, subject, and genre (see Figures 2-9). 

# Draft 2

Libraries are in the business of acquiring, processing, maintaining, and circulating to patrons physical and digital information resources (i.e. monographs, e-books, journals, reference materials, articles, archival manuscripts, videos, databases, maps, etc.).

Catalogers create, create, update, and maintain metadata to carefully describe a library's information resources so that these resources are available in time of need. 

Authority control is concerned with making sure key metadata for an information resource is recorded consistently. When the metadata is consistent it provides multiple benefits:
