# Definition


"Knowledge carefully recorded is knowledge available in time of need"[ref]. 

- predictable (e.g. if I want to find works by or about Mark Twain I search under Twain, Mark not Clemens, Samuel)
- differentiate or disambiguate or reconcile between entities and seeming duplicate entities (e.g. Thomas Mann vs. Thomas Mann; James Dean vs. James Dean; Harrison Ford vs. Harrison Ford)
- collate related and like resources (find all resources by William Shakespeare vs. about William Shakespeare)

# Draft 1

Libraries are in the business of acquiring, processing, maintaining, and circulating to patrons physical and digital information resources (i.e. monographs, e-books, journals, reference materials, articles, archival manuscripts, videos, databases, maps, etc.). Libraries, create, update, and maintain metadata to carefully describe the library's information resources so that these resources are available in time of need. Cataloging is the set of activities and processes that creates, updates, and maintains metadata describing information resources. These activities and processes include description, subject analysis, and classification. Metadata for an information resource is organized in a bibliographic record. Bibliographic records are collected together into a database called the library catalog. The bibliographic record contains the metadata to describe, differentiate, relate, and locate an information resource. The bibliographic record acts as a surrogate for the information resource. 

Authority control (also referred to as authority work) is the set of activities and processes to establish, through verification and validation, controlled headings or terms for various entity types (i.e. people, places, corporate bodies, families, series, works, expressions, subjects, and genres) used in information resource description. Authority control creates a database of consistent, unique terms that includes variant terms, related terms, other associated attributes, and sources of information. These various elements are recorded together in an authority record. This database of authority records can also be referred to as an authority file. The established or authorized form chosen in an authority record is the form used in the description and subject analysis of an information resource acquired by a library. Using these controlled terms creates predictable and consistent metadata that can be used to differentiate between similar entities and collate together related resources.

Authority records consist of four major components: the authorized form of the entity, variant forms (i.e. synonyms), attributes and information about the entity, and source information to support the choices made in establishing this entity. Authority records can be formatted using various metadata encoding standards. Libraries primarily encode authority records using the MARC format for authority data (refs/footnote?). Figure 1 illustrates a MARC authority record for a person entity. Tags 000, 001, 005, and 008 represent fixed field data that determines various information about this record including the type of record this represents and how the record can be used. Tags 010 and 035 are control numbers for this authority record to uniquely identify this record in library systems and databases. Tag 040 shows information about the language, content standard for the metadata, and the institutions that contributed to the creation and maintenance of this record. Tag 046 shows important dates related to the entity including birth and death dates. The form of the personal name established in the 100 tag is the authorized form for this person meaning that anytime an information resource by or about this person is added to the library catalog the metadata description for the item will use this form of their name. 

The 3XX tags represent attributes associated with this person including related locations (e.g. birth and death place), areas of activity, occupation, associated organizations, gender, language, and fuller form of their name. The 4XX tags are variant forms of their name that provide “see also” references to guide patrons and staff to the established form in the 1XX tag. The 6XX tags provide additional notes that guide catalogers in using the data in this record. The 670 tags are sources showing evidence for the decisions and metadata included in this record. Most importantly these sources show evidence for the form of the name chosen in the 1XX field. Any 9XX tags store local information specific to the source database for this record. In addition to personal names authority records are created for places, corporate bodies, families, series, works, expressions, subjects, and genres (ref; note to additional external examples).
