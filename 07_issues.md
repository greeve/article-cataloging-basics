# Draft

Advances in computer and networking technologies including the move towards linked data and semantic web is influencing the evolution of cataloging and authority control. Computing and networking technologies enable a federated network of authority files and databases that are increasingly interconnected and open. Services like VIAF and ISNI are example authority aggregators that collect established authorities from various authority databases throughout the world and provide a portal for librarians and information scientists to identify established authorities. The Library of Congress’s Linked Data Service is an example of a national institution providing access to their authority metadata for use by catalogers as well as developers working on library metadata systems and discovery tools. ORCID (Open Researcher and Contributor ID) (ref?) is a service that allows scientific and academic authors and contributors to uniquely identify themselves regardless of how their name is referenced in a publication so that their creative works are correctly attributed and collated together. This service acts as a form of authority control to disambiguate authors and their scholarly contributions. Wikidata (ref?) from the Wikimedia Foundation is a core service of the WWW and the semantic web that enables establishing and interlinking entities between various authority databases and services to more fully describe and disambiguate people, places, works, subjects, and genres. Similar to VIAF, it provides a portal for bringing together the various authorized forms of an entity to a single location for reference and use. Adding the unique identifier for Wikidata to a library authority file would provide access to other authority sources that could help library staff and patrons uniquely identify entities for their work and research.

Developed from the early 2000s, linked data and the semantic web (refs) are technologies and best practices for publishing data on the WWW. Central to these technologies and best practices is the use of URIs to uniquely identify an entity rather than relying on the string representation (or label) for a given entity (ref to strings to things idea?). The use of URIs in authority work at a library setting is an increasing trend that will facilitate more implicit linking of entities to other datasets, data repositories, and catalogs that exist in the WWW. These links will enable a graph of linked entities that can be related and traversed in ways that reveal new paths of knowledge and understanding that weren’t present previously. These services and technologies illustrate the move away from thinking of authority control as one part of cataloging and bibliographic description where authorized forms of names, titles, subjects, and genres are established and used as distinct access points in a catalog record towards entity and identity management where cataloging and authority control become one and the same.
