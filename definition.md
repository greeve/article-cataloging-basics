# Authority control definition

Cataloging is the set of activities and processes to describe information resources, including description, subject analysis and classification. 

Describing information resources involves choosing headings or terms to help identify the resource. 

Cataloging produces bibliographic records that contain metadata describing information resources. The bibliographic record acts as a surrogate for the information resource. 

Authority control or authority work is the set of activities and processes to establish, through verification and validation, controlled forms of entities (i.e. people, places, corporate bodies, families, subjects, and genres) used in information resource description.

Authority control creates a database of consistent, unique terms that includes variant terms, related terms, other associated attributes, and sources of information to disambiguate entities. These various elements that distinguish one entity from another are recorded together in an authority record. This database of authority records is sometimes referred to as an authority file. 

Authority records consist of four major components: the authorized form of the entity, variant forms (i.e. synonyms), attributes and information about the entity, and source information to support the choices made in establishing this entity. 

Authority control disambiguates entities so that catalogers and patrons know which entity to use when cataloging or searching the library catalog for information resources.
