# Draft

In the process of cataloging an information resource the cataloger chooses main headings to uniquely identify the resource (e.g. by choosing the item’s author, series title, subject, additional contributors, etc.) and collate related resources. If the chosen heading (or entity) to best represent the information resource exists in their authority database they will use that existing heading. If the entity doesn’t exist yet in the authority database the cataloger will establish that authority entity by creating a new authority record in a cooperative authority database (if they participate in a cooperative cataloging program) as well as adding the authority record to their local authority database in their library’s ILS.

Libraries maintain a local authority file using a variety of means including batch loading records, partnering with library vendors, participating in cooperative cataloging programs, and manually creating or editing authority records one-by-one. A library’s local authority database is maintained as part of their integrated library system (ILS) alongside other library metadata including bibliographic records. The ILS does the work of forming relationships between authority records and their use in bibliographic records for disambiguating disparate resources and collating related resources. The library catalog or discovery system that a library uses to help patrons search, browse, and discover information resources offered can utilize the information recorded in the authority record to collate materials with bibliographic metadata that shares the same authorized headings, direct patrons from variant forms and terms to the authorized form, and disambiguate similar headings in search results.

A library’s local authority database stands in contrast to cooperative (or aggregate) authority databases maintained at a regional, national, or international scale. Libraries can participate in cooperative cataloging programs allowing them access to a pool of shared authority records as well as the ability to contribute new or updated records to the shared database. The Library of Congress’s Program for Cooperative Cataloging (PCC) maintains various cooperative cataloging initiatives including the Name Authority Cooperative Program (NACO) and the Subject Authority Cooperative Program (SACO). These two cooperative programs work with OCLC, Inc. to create and maintain a national database of authority records that can be leveraged by libraries in the creation and maintenance of their own local catalog.
